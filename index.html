                    Lets start off big- as in great heights. This is a fear that keeps me uneasy walking slowly across bridges and one that prevents me from looking down.I feel its healthy, a sort of self preservation measure that kicks in. What is interesting is I have this want to try sky diving, base jumping or things that involve great heights. Maybe I donâ€™t understand quite fully where this fear comes from.
