                    Lets start off big- as in great heights. This is a fear that keeps me uneasy walking slowly across bridges and one that prevents me from looking down.I feel its healthy, a sort of self preservation measure that kicks in. What is interesting is I have this want to try sky diving, base jumping or things that involve great heights. Maybe I donâ€™t understand quite fully where this fear comes from.

                    Heres to spiders never growing larger than the bottom of my foot. Too harsh? Possibly so. It may be the way they move around on their eight legs that creeps me out. Or maybe its the eyes on these anthropoids but something about them absolutely terrifies me. Especially when I walk into their invisible web of traps they seem to set in front of entrances that sets me into a panic slapping session.
